## Materials

#### Types of materials: 

- metals
	- ferrous
		- iron
	- non-ferous
		- copper, zinc, tin, gold
	- alloy
		- bronze (copper + tin)
		- steel (iron + carbon)
		- brass (copper + zinc)
- polymer materials
	- plastic
		- PVC
	- rubber
- ceramics
- sand composite
	- concrete
	- 
#### Osnova:

- **materials surrounds us everywhere**
- **what are the main types**
- **what can be made of them**
- why we have to try to **consider everything** when **choosing a right material** for a specific tool, building or machine
	- pros and cons
- how we can process metal
	- **casting** - the oldest known process
		- moulding => melting => casting
		- empty cavity is filled with molten metal => left to solidify into the shape
		- compex shapes
	- **drawing** - process for producing wires, bars and tubes
		- pulling material throught a series of dies => increased lenght
			- sheet metal drawing and wire 
		- two main types => sheet + wire drawing
		- mostly done in room temp but can be elevated to higher one
			- rods (tyče) or hollow (duté) sections => reduce forces
	- **forging** - one i like the most (medieval and knights)
		- metal is heated and shaped by compressive force
			- hammer | press
		- used to produce large quantities of identical parts 
			- machine parts in todays industries (cars...)
		- cold forging => low temperatrue for solf metals and plastic
		- hot forging => metal can be shaped without breaking
	- **rolling**
		- pair of rollers
	- **extrusion**
		- cross-section profiles
		- can be used for food, brics, complex pipes ....
	- **sheet**
		- thin flat pieces => can be bent into different shapes
- why do we make alloys
	- properties of each material (mechanical, thermal, electric-magnetic)
	- usage of these aloys 
	- problems with each one in daily life => expansion of bridges
- statotest
- magnetic and electrical properities of materials
	- wires, IT, glass wires => optic cables

#### Slovíčka:

- brittleness (křehkost)
- density (hustota)
- elasticity (pružnost)
- fatigue (vyčeprání materiálu)
- hardness (tvrdost)
- malleability (kujnost)
- resitivity (odolnost)
- to strain (napnout)
- to strecht (natáhnout)
- to shear (rozstříhat)
- melting point
- tensile strenght (tahová) 
- expansion
