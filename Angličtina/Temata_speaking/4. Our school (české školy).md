## El. circuit

- is a circuit or network with paythay throught => el. current can flow
- consist of
	- **power source**
		- generator, battery, socket
	- wires (paths)
		- fuse => when high amount of current passes through network (**shortuct**) => it melts down => break circuit
			- 
	- **device / load**
- closed circuit => working circuit with no open or broken connections
	- can 'broke' the circuit with a switch
- load turns electricity into more useful form
	- light bulbs (light energy)
	- motors (mechanical energy)
	- speakers (sound)
- parallel circuit
	- more branches 
	- if one path burns out => others are still working
	- used to connect appliacnce at home  => each socket is independent

### Osnova:

- What is electric circuit
	- used in a variety of applications - including power supplies, audio amplifiers, and communication systems
- What is it made of 
	- components - resistors, capacitors, transistors, and diodes
- basic electronic circuit (battery + LED + switch + resistor to control the flow of electricity)
- Integrated circuits (ICs) are a type of electronic circuit that contains multiple components on a single chip. They are commonly used in electronic devices like smartphones and computers.
- The field of electronics continues to advance, with new developments like the Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable technology driving innovation in electronic circuit design.
- As technology continues to evolve, the design and implementation of electronic circuits will remain a vital aspect of modern engineering and innovation.
